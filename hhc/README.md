# hhc - simple haskell hash cracker

Main assumptions

The project is meant NOT to be competitive to any other password crackers. It's just a side-product of haskell self-study.

TODO:
- multithreading
- other than brute-force modes (dictionary, dictionary with rules)
- other algorithms: MD5, SHA*, RipeMD, ...
- testing [partly done]
- optimization
