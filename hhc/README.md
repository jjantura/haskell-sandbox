# hhc - simple haskell hash cracker

Main assumptions

The project is meant NOT to be competitive to any other password crackers. It's just a side-product of haskell self-study.

TODO:
- other algorithms: MD5, SHA*, RipeMD, ... [done]
- other than brute-force modes (dictionary, dictionary with rules) [done]
- testing [partly done]
- benchmarking single and multithreaded [partly done]
- hash validation (length, content)
- multithreading
- optimization
